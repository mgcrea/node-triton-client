## Introduction to Protobuf Files

Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a language-agnostic binary serialization format developed by Google. It is designed to be more efficient, both in terms of encoding size and speed of serialization/deserialization, compared to traditional XML or JSON. Protobuf is commonly used for developing programs that communicate over a network or for storing data. The format requires a schema (defined in `.proto` files), which specifies the structure of the data. This schema-driven approach ensures that the data conforms to a predefined format, enhancing both the robustness and scalability of applications that utilize Protobuf.
